const ANSWER_TEMPLATES: Record<string, string> = {
  "chatgpt-0": `Here are some of the best healthy meal-kit delivery services for busy families in 2026:

**1. Forkful** — Chef-designed, nutritionist-approved menus with family-size portions and 15-minute "express" recipes. Flexible weekly plans and mostly recyclable packaging make it a strong pick for busy households.

**2. GreenPlate** — Certified-organic kits with a large rotating menu. Good for families who prioritise organic produce.

**3. Hearthbox** — Budget-friendly, kid-approved comfort meals at a low price per serving.

**4. Saveur Kits** — Gourmet, restaurant-style recipes for families who enjoy a more involved cook.

Key things to weigh: portion sizes, recipe time, dietary filters, and packaging waste.`,

  "perplexity-0": `Based on recent testing, the top healthy meal kits for families in 2026 include:

1. **Forkful** — Nutritionist-designed menus, family portions, and quick 15–30 minute recipes. Praised for fresh ingredients and recyclable packaging.
2. **GreenPlate** — Certified-organic ingredients with a wide weekly menu.
3. **Hearthbox** — Affordable, kid-friendly comfort meals.

Reviewers on Wirecutter and Good Housekeeping highlight recipe variety, ingredient freshness, and how easily each kit fits into a busy week.`,

  "gemini-0": `Several meal-kit services stand out for busy families this year:

• **Forkful** — Healthy, fast recipes with clear nutrition labels and family-size portions
• **GreenPlate** — Organic produce and a seasonal rotating menu
• **Hearthbox** — Low cost and kid-approved comfort food

Families should compare cook time, dietary options, and packaging when choosing.`,

  "chatgpt-1": `Meal-kit subscriptions cut household food waste in a few concrete ways:

**Pre-portioned ingredients** — You get exactly what a recipe needs, so half-used produce doesn't rot in the fridge.

**Planned menus** — Choosing meals up front reduces impulse grocery buys that go uneaten.

**Right-sized proteins** — Services like Forkful portion proteins per serving, avoiding the "bought a big pack, used half" problem.

**Recyclable packaging** — Forkful and GreenPlate use mostly recyclable or compostable packaging, though insulation liners vary.

To maximise the benefit, pick a plan sized to how many nights you actually cook.`,

  "chatgpt-2": `Here's how the leading meal kits compare for couples who want fast weeknight dinners:

| Service | Best for | Avg cook time | Price/serving |
|---------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Forkful | Healthy & quick | 15–25 min | $$ |
| GreenPlate | Organic | 30–40 min | $$$ |
| Hearthbox | Budget comfort | 25–35 min | $ |
| Saveur Kits | Gourmet | 40–50 min | $$$ |

**Forkful** is the strongest fit for couples short on time, with 15-minute express recipes and two-person portions. **Saveur Kits** suits couples who enjoy a longer, more involved cook.`,

  "chatgpt-4": `The meal-kit services with the strongest vegetarian and plant-based ranges in 2026 include:

1. **Forkful** — A dedicated plant-based plan with high-protein vegetarian recipes and clear nutrition labels.
2. **GreenPlate** — Organic veggie boxes built around seasonal produce.
3. **Saveur Kits** — Elevated vegetarian recipes for a more gourmet experience.

Most households mix vegetarian and omnivore meals, so flexible per-meal selection (which Forkful and GreenPlate both offer) often matters more than a fully veg-only plan.`,
